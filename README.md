# About
In this repo I'll put interesting things about engeneering topics explained in a simply mathematical form.
These examples are itended (with love) for engeneering (or similar) students, studying the basical sciences cicle (linear algebra, vectorial calculus, clasical mechanics, etc).
If you are one of these, probably you'll be interested on see how basical math principes are exploted to do awsome things (with a little changes and improvements in the real life).

## Work In Progress
I hope can I finish this soon.

# Gime some examples
 - How your (analog) radio works?
 - How can I defeat the ambience (electrical) noise in ECG, in order to measure a very very little cardiac signal?
 - Radar technology in home: How can a router find your mobile phone and focus the signal in this direction?
Linear Algebra, sure.

# Another (advanced) examples
 - From AC to DC using the Fourier transform (and some tricks)
 - Removing electrical noise, with an algebraic least-squares approach in a random process vector space.

# About Me
I'm an electronic engineering student in Universidad de Buenos Aires, actually working on my degree thesis. I'm focused in signal processing and control theory, this is why most of this examples are related with these topics.

# Why Broken English?
Because I'm not an native speaker, but:
- many people around the world can read this language
- many papers (the most) are in (sometimes broken-) english
- you can use google translate

# Some words
Dedicated to my beloved @verosupervero, who take care about me and always tells me not to stay up late and go to sleep.

# Comments?
Sure (?). Send them me at fernandodanko@gmail.com
